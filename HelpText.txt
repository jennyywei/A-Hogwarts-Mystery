Welcome to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the premier wizarding school
where aspiring wizards and witches in Britain, like yourself, can study all there is to know
about magic! Here, you can explore various branches of magic like Transfiguration,
Charms, Potions…

Wait, you’re not here to study? Well then, I have another mission for you! Behind the
stone walls of Hogwarts, the evil dark wizard Voldemort has split his soul into fragments
called Horcruxes. As long as the Horcruxes exist, Voldemort has the power of immortality
and cannot be killed. The only way to defeat him is to destroy all of the Horcruxes,
rendering him mortal again. Five of the Horcruxes are scattered about the school; your
mission is to find and destroy the Horcruxes so that Voldemort can be defeated once and
for all!

I will be your eyes and hands.  Direct me with natural English commands; I don't
understand all of the English language, but I do a pretty good job. The journey through
Hogwarts is one full of twists and turns; you'd best make yourself a map as you go along.
Much of my vocabulary describes places and is used to move you there. To move, try words
like EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, or BACK. Occasionally, you might even need
to enter a special password to get into a room. I also know about a number of objects
hidden within Hogwarts which you can TAKE or DROP.  To see what objects you're carrying,
say INVENTORY. To reprint the detailed description of where you are, say LOOK. If you want
to end your adventure, say QUIT.
